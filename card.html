						Green sea turtles are unique among sea turtles because
						they
						are herbivores, primarily feeding on seagrasses and
						algae.
						This diet gives their fat a greenish hue, hence their
						name.
						They also exhibit extensive long-distance migrations,
						traveling thousands of miles between feeding grounds and
						nesting beaches.
